zigbuild seems to be a great way to use zig as a linker for cross compiling rust code for gnu targets

start by installing zigbuild:

cargo install zigbuild

install ziglang

for windows:

choco install zig

for mac:

brew install zig

for linux:

apt install zig

add target with rustup:

rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

this does not currently work for aarch64 windows as that is msvc only

then to run zigbuild with a crate

cargo zigbuild --target aarch64-apple-darwin
